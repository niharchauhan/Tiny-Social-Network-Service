**Tiny Social Network Service (SNS)**

The Tiny Social Network Service (SNS) project is a basic social networking platform enabling user connections, following/unfollowing others, and posting messages on personal timelines. It comprises two main components: the server (tsd.cc), which processes gRPC requests and manages user data, and the client (tsc.cc), which allows users to interact with the server. The project employs gRPC for efficient client-server communication and real-time messaging.
